Providing a channel to stop the spread of fake news and rumors and validating real medicines using blockchain.

Due to the virus tremendous rumours and false news is being spread which can even lead to death, the people actually suffering from the disease are also afraid of getting taurmatized and accused of spreading the disease, we hope to build a ethereum dapp to make a public chain of news incidents in the area thereby making the correct news reach all, preventing fake news from spreading and still keeping the people involved fully anonymous. This can be furthered used by news channels for sensitive cases like rape. Furthermore we plan to make a drug validation dapp from which people can identify duplicate drugs from real ones by scanning their unique private key.
